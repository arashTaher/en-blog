  <h1>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, SICP</h1>

<div id="post">
	<p>In this semester I'd took an optional course titled "Declarative programming". I was so thrilled about it because of two reasons :</p>

<p>First of all, I'd already been enchanted by the whole idea of functional and declarative programming since I was fooling around languages like Erlang, Haskell and Prolog (Although the last one is technically a logic programming language); Secondly, I was long to experience the presence in class of one of our well-known instructors, Dr. Towhidi.The reference book for this class was also notable, the renown Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( or better known<a href="http://arashtaher.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sicp.jpg"><img src="http://arashtaher.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sicp.jpg" alt="SICP" /></a> as <a href="mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> ).
Norvig is his famous must-read article,<a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html"> Learn programming in ten years</a>, recommended this book for those who wants to choose computers as a life career.</p>

<blockquote>"SICP is probably the best introduction to computer science, and it does teach programming as a way of understanding the computer science ... The book is challenging and will weed out some people who perhaps could be successful with another approach."</blockquote>


<p>This book may not make a almighty coder who can do some fancy stuff with just a couple of lines of codes (although in some chapters, it will), but it can teach you something far more valuable, Good habits in thinking and coding. It reminds me of a statement that one the pioneers in software engineering, Kent Beck says about himself : "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."</p>

<p>The programming language used in this book is Scheme. It's some how old and incredibly small ( Parans, Blanks and lexemes are all the elements you have and a pair of data is the only data structure); Despite that it will amaze you when you see how complex tasks can be accomplished with such simple elements.</p>

<p>All these cool stuff can best accompanied with this fact that <a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002/">Coursera </a>presented a course in functional programming that it's syllabus is based on this book; The only difference is that this course has chosen Scala programming language over Scheme, which is much more sophisticated and has a rise in usage. (It supports OO programming )</p>

<p>Final word : Don't miss the chance if you have this opportunity to attend a class that teaches this book, or if you have enough time and and know yourself as a guy with iron determination, try to take the course on Coursera. Unfortunately in my opinion it's not a book that you can get the best of it by reading by yourself.</p>
