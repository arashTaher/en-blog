	<p>It's been more than a year that I'm monkey coding in a some-how large scale company and getting my head around real coding. In a year that I spend in industry I found some of most important tools and concepts that I use in my every day job, are the the ones that I didn't heard a word about them in school. Here's the three most important God-knows-why-they-do-not-teach-us-in-university things that are at top of my head</p>

    
	<li><span>02 Apr 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/codes/2014/04/02/path-navigator.html"><b>Path Navigator</b></a></li>
	<p>A couple of month ago I started a tiny program as a hobby that would let you to easily open new directories and navigate between them without moving your hand off your keyboard. It was an attempt to eliminate mouse in this process, yet making it real simple by giving auto-completion. Kind of like tab-completion in Bash, but now for Windows Explorer.</p>

    
	<li><span>14 Mar 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/coding/2014/03/14/editing-code-whilst-preserving-its-formatting.html"><b>Editing C# AST, Yet preserving its formatting</b></a></li>
	<p>Earlier in one of my <a href="http://arashtaher.wordpress.com/2013/09/27/prettyprint/">posts</a>, I explained how can you reformat your code using NRefactory library. But, as matter of fact what you really want in your day to day task is not reformatting code, au-contraire, you want its formatting to be preserved. You don't want to commit dozens of files to your repository merely because their formatting's changed !</p>

	<p>I'm using Feedly on my tablet on a daily basis for checking weblogs, and I use Pocket to read them later.</p>

    
	<li><span>11 Mar 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/coding/2014/03/11/binary-operator-expressions.html"><b>Binary Operator Expressions</b></a></li>
	<p>Suppose in a hypothetical scenario you want to reverse all binary operation in your file, and also you want them to be fully parenthesized. What would you do ?</p>

    
	<li><span>07 Nov 2013</span> &raquo; <a href="/codes/en/2013/11/07/rec-set-part.html"><b>Recursive problems : Set partitioning</b></a></li>
	<p>There's no doubt that recursion is one the most powerful, exciting, and yet difficult approaches for problem solving and as we all know, attacking a problem by this almighty tool, requires keen mind and craftsmanship in extracting a recursive structure; a subtle perspective that can only be acquired by constant practicing. (Reminds me of Pride and prejudice, have you read it ?)</p>

	<p>Yet another code example via NRefactory. This time we intend to take advantage of reformatting capabilities in NRefactory library.</p>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory">NRefactroy</a> is an open source library for parsing C# source codes, or more precisely a front-end parser for C#.
It can parse your C# codes and provide you with an abstract syntax tree. It can also resolve this parse tree and give you semantic of nodes in the syntax tree.</p>

    
	<li><span>10 Aug 2013</span> &raquo; <a href="/articles/computer%20topics/2013/08/10/practitioner.html"><b>Practitioner</b></a></li>
	<p>Yesterday, I was finally honored to contribute to an open source project, NRefactory: Front-end parser for C#.
Although, I have to admit I was only a helper through this journey; In fact at first I was totally reluctant to dive into thousands lines of code. After all, itâ€™s still a bit scary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" />
Anyway we did it, we found the problem and add our short piece of modification into the code.</p>

	<li><span>18 Jul 2013</span> &raquo; <a href="/codes/2013/07/18/scheme-repl.html"><b>Scheme REPL</b></a></li>
	<p>A rudimentary implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL </a>for Scheme programs in Python (as usual).  Descriptions for implementation has been taken from chapter 4 of SICP book. At it's core, it's merely an Eval, Apply cycle. <a href="http://ge.tt/6UdsX7m/v/0">Enjoy it</a>.</p>

	<p>In this semester I'd took an optional course titled "Declarative programming". I was so thrilled about it because of two reasons :</p>

	<p>There's nothing out there that can be considered as a worthy replacement for bash. The power it gives you is so enormous that it takes year for someone to become a real proficient.</p>

	<p>Here's a simple scheduler simulator in Python that you can download from <a href="http://ge.tt/27PfW5L/v/0?c">here</a>.
You give it a list of processes and scheduling algorithm you want to be used for scheduling and as result you get a simple output like this which shows you the sequence of the processes running in intervals :</p>

	<p>I myself had some problems to grasp what virtual memory is and how it manages memory . after a lots of reading and surfing I found these resources much more comprehensive than others .
So if you want to start to know what is virtual memory, page table , TLB and etc. I recommend to check out these websites :</p>
