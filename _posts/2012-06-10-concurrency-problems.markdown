In this semester I've taken a course in Concurrency . One of the most delightful courses I ever taken .

As exercise, I started to work on some classical and less-classical problems on concurrency from "[A little book on semaphores](www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/)" by Daweny . the result of my attempts is a bunch codes in Python ( and one in C ) which you can download from [here](http://ge.tt/8gpNhuI/v/0?c) .

The solved problems include :
Producer-Consumer problem ( also available in C ),
Dining philosophers,
Dining Savages,
River crossing problem and
Barbershop problem .
