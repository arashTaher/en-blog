"Come on dude, that's dull. let's do some web stuff, That's where money is."

"C ? are you kidding me ?  Haven ever you heard about Java ? You just import some library and that's it."

I know, I know what you're saying, I know what you're thinking. Nowadays people don't want to get into details ( especially people whom I know ). You have a box, you know the language, you send queries, you get response, easy peasy, right ?
If you know the right tools, there's no need to labor for hours to write and debug . you can easily make that thing work with minimum amount of effort.

Well, that's fine and I have no objection to that. There's only one tiny problem: it's not fun.
All you have to do is to be familiar with some "cool technologies" and use them. How do they work ? Well, Until they give you what you want, that doesn't matter. In case of any problem ?  You visit their web page for new updates. If that didn't work for you, you'll search for another one .

It's not mind stimulating, it's not productive and it's not fun, and also it's so annoying when you do not know what is happening underneath. It's like living and working with someone you barley know. To me, it's a perplexing situation.
In my opinion, you better don't touch something if you don't know how it works, unless you want to figure out how it is working. Also your imagination is bound to the amount of your knowledge about that thing. You know the words well, you may become a good writer; you know colors, you have this chance to become an excellent painter; you want to be a proficient in computers, learn to read hex numbers :)

So, the basic tools you need to know what's happening down there in computers, is C and, Ass ... wait for it ... Assembly .
Now put your mask on, we are about dive in :D

PS : It was suppose to be a short prologue to a cracking problem I found in a website, but words just came out out . So, let it be our next post ...
