In this semester I'd took an optional course titled "Declarative programming". I was so thrilled about it because of two reasons :

First of all, I'd already been enchanted by the whole idea of functional and declarative programming since I was fooling around languages like Erlang, Haskell and Prolog (Although the last one is technically a logic programming language); Secondly, I was long to experience the presence in class of one of our well-known instructors, Dr. Towhidi.The reference book for this class was also notable, the renown Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ( or better known[![SICP](http://arashtaher.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sicp.jpg)](http://arashtaher.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/sicp.jpg) as [SICP](mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) ).
Norvig is his famous must-read article,[ Learn programming in ten years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), recommended this book for those who wants to choose computers as a life career.


<blockquote>"SICP is probably the best introduction to computer science, and it does teach programming as a way of understanding the computer science ... The book is challenging and will weed out some people who perhaps could be successful with another approach."</blockquote>


This book may not make a almighty coder who can do some fancy stuff with just a couple of lines of codes (although in some chapters, it will), but it can teach you something far more valuable, Good habits in thinking and coding. It reminds me of a statement that one the pioneers in software engineering, Kent Beck says about himself : "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."

The programming language used in this book is Scheme. It's some how old and incredibly small ( Parans, Blanks and lexemes are all the elements you have and a pair of data is the only data structure); Despite that it will amaze you when you see how complex tasks can be accomplished with such simple elements.

All these cool stuff can best accompanied with this fact that [Coursera ](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-002/)presented a course in functional programming that it's syllabus is based on this book; The only difference is that this course has chosen Scala programming language over Scheme, which is much more sophisticated and has a rise in usage. (It supports OO programming )

Final word : Don't miss the chance if you have this opportunity to attend a class that teaches this book, or if you have enough time and and know yourself as a guy with iron determination, try to take the course on Coursera. Unfortunately in my opinion it's not a book that you can get the best of it by reading by yourself.
