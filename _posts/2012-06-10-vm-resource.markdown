I myself had some problems to grasp what virtual memory is and how it manages memory . after a lots of reading and surfing I found these resources much more comprehensive than others .
So if you want to start to know what is virtual memory, page table , TLB and etc. I recommend to check out these websites :

[A conscious overview on VM
What is happening underneath
VM in detail](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~solomon/cs537/html/paging.html) ( Highly recommended )

Another resource that might come in handy is a series of videos by Dr. Murphy which is available on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1B-U0Frws&feature=BFa&list=SP56B156F5D73BBD77) .

You may also find a bunch of tutorials about OS ( including Memory management, kernel programming and ... ) in [here](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/index) .
